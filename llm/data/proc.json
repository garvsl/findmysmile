    "Zirconia Crown": {
      "What is Zirconium Crown?": "The element Zirconium, a white hard metal, is used in dentistry as 'zirconia (zirconium dioxide)'. It is a bio-compatible restorative material with very high fracture resistance. It is also a suitable choice for patients who are allergic to metal elements such as nickel-titanium.",
      "In Which Dental Treatments Zirconia Treatment is Used?": "Thanks to its light translucence, preparability and polishable structure, it may be used in the construction of all anterior/posterior restorations. It is one of the preferred restoration materials in dentistry as it is tissue friendly.",
      "How Are Zirconia Crowns Applied?": "Depending on the type of restoration and the amount of healthy teeth, preparations are made on the teeth. Utilizing 3D digital scanners, the patient's tooth impressions are taken. A digital model of the tooth to be produced is created on the computer and crowns are produced in 3-axis zirconia manufacturing devices. It is baked after making the final touches according to the photographs of the patient, and the process is completed with the final polish to provide a natural appearance.",
      "How to Care for Your Zirconia Veneers?": "Caring for your zirconia veneers is no different from your natural teeth. Your veneers should be brushed twice a day and spaces between each tooth should be cleaned regularly with dental floss. Like every patient, patients with zirconia veneers should not neglect routine dental check-ups every 6 months.",
      "What are the Aesthetic Advantages of Zirconia Teeth?": "In metal-supported porcelain which is an older method than zirconium crowns, the inner surface of the crowns are covered with gray metals. These crowns are obtained by stacking tooth-colored porcelain on metals. However, due to the transparent structure of the porcelain, the silhouette of the gray metal underneath becomes clear over time and the veneers appear more dull than natural teeth. Zirconia teeth are one-piece restorations and all of them are the same color as teeth. In addition, by giving the effect of transparency to their ends like how natural teeth looks, an aesthetic appearance suitable for the person's own tooth structure is provided.",
      "How Many Days Does It Take to Get Zirconium Veneer Teeth?": "Thanks to advancing technology, the impression of the teeth is taken digitally and instantly sent to the laboratory, and the designs are made in a digital environment within minutes. In this way, it is possible to save time by converting the impression to physical form and save on waiting for courier delivery times to the lab. These lab waiting times which were used to be 4-5 days in the past have now shortened to such a time frame that allows same day's evening deliveries from the lab with impressions taken in the morning.",
      "Will I Feel Any Pain During the Zirconium Crown Treatment?": "All teeth to be restored are numbed with digital anesthesia before the procedure, and temporary restorations are attached to the patient's teeth before the numbness disappears, ensuring that the quality of life standard of medicine is maintained through temporary veneers until the new teeth comes in.",
      "What Should I Be Aware of After Getting Zirconia Crowns?": "As long as the patient follows the daily routine of oral hygiene after getting the crowns and attends dental check-ups every 6 months, there is no need for an extra procedure or prevention method. Zirconia dental crowns are pressure resistant like our own teeth and are suitable for the daily routine like chewing food.",
      "Can Zirconia Crowns be Applied to Those Who are Allergic to Metal?": "Allergy was common in old metal-supported dental crowns. Zirconium allergy, on the other hand, is quite rare, though it varies from patient to patient compared to metal-supported crowns. Therefore, zirconium is a priority option for individuals prone to allergies.",
      "Do Zirconia Crowns Have Change in Tooth Color Later on?": "Discoloration does not occur on zirconium crowns over time. It stays in the mouth for extra long years as long as the patient follows a daily oral hygiene routine and going to regular dentist check-ups every 6 months.",
      "Is It Common for Zirconia Crowns to Break or Fall off?": "As long as the chewing movements and the relationship of two jawbones with each other are correctly determined, no breakage would be expected in daily use. The fracture resistance of zirconia is higher than teeth. However a severe trauma, accidental strong impact might cause the tooth to break. The chemical properties of the adhesives that we call 'cements' used in the bonding of zirconia veneers have ideal properties for staying in place. The methods to increase the retention are also used during the preparation of the teeth, and it is a rare situation that crowns come off.",
      "Can Zirconia Crowns be Applied to Those With Gum Disease?": "It is not a correct procedure to apply crowns when the patient's gums are inflamed. In the presence of a possible gingivitis, the aim is to give a healthy appearance by treating the gums first. Afterwards, a compatible zirconia crown that does not harm the gums should be planned and applied."

    "Porcelain Laminate Veneers": {
      "What Are Porcelain Laminate Veneers?": "Lamina is the Latin word for 'leaf'. In this method, the entire teeth surface is not trimmed, only the front surfaces are trimmed 0.3 to 0.7 mm. Therefore, the loss of healthy tooth tissue is kept to the minimum. In this procedure, porcelain veneers are attached to the trimmed areas.",
      "In Which Cases Are Porcelain Veneers Applied?": "In cases of irreversible discoloration with dental bleaching, teeth with poor structure and shape, in the treatment of diastema (diastema closure), in the restoration of broken or worn teeth, in the replacement of old fillings with damaged color and structure, in fixing crowded and crooked teeth (it can be preferred as an alternative cosmetic treatment).",
      "Who Can Receive the Porcelain Veneer Therapy?": "Almost everyone may receive porcelain veneer therapy.",
      "Are There Any Conditions Where Porcelain Veneers May Not Be Applied?": "The porcelain laminate veneer therapy cannot be applied to patients who have jaw deformities such as severe gingival recession, bad habits such as nail-biting and pencil biting, as well as severely crowded teeth and perplexity.",
      "How Many Sessions Do Porcelain Veneers Take?": "If your gums do not need an aesthetic operation or any other treatment, the therapy is estimated to be completed in 2 to 3 sessions within a week.",
      "What Are The Stages of Porcelain Veneer Therapy?": "During the first session, the impression of your teeth is taken before trimming, followed by the examination of the obtained model. Next, your teeth are trimmed and the impression of your teeth is re-taken using sensitive impression material. In the next session, the laminates are applied to your teeth.",
      "Will the Porcelain Laminate Veneers Fall Off?": "The adhesion level is very high for the veneers thanks to cutting-edge technology. If the dentist pays attention to the technical details for precision, you may use your porcelain laminate veneers as if they are your natural teeth.",
      "What Is the Lifespan of Porcelain Veneers?": "Porcelain veneers may be used for years with proper oral care. They are manufactured from porcelain and its outstanding quality ensures them to be more durable than veneers produced from other materials. They are more resistant to stains and erosion. It is necessary to pay attention to oral care to extend their lifespan.",
      "What Are the Advantages of Porcelain Veneers?": "The desired look is achieved with a minimal trimming of 0.3 to 0.7 mm. The process takes between 7 to 10 days on average. They are produced from durable and discoloration-resistant materials. Desired aesthetic properties (color, shape, etc.) without damaging the natural structure of the teeth is possible to be achieved with porcelain veneers. Either no or minimal changes are applied to the teeth. The trimmed layer is between only 0.3 and 0.7 mm. The model of your teeth you want changes on is duplicated and new design is performed based on this model. In other words, before the operation, the planned changes can be shown as a demonstration at the beginning of the treatment. This is called a 'mock-up'. The porcelain surface of veneers are smooth, so it decreases the likelihood of plaque build-up and staining due to smoking etc. It does not discolor due to external factors such as coffee, tea, and smoking. It is highly resistant to erosion."

    "All On Four Implants": {
      "What is All On Four Implant Technique?": "All On Four implant technique is a procedure enabling to fix tooth prosthesis on four pieces of dental implant placed at certain angles in patients with no teeth.",
      "What Are The Advantages of All On Four Implant Technique?": "We can list the advantages of All On Four treatment as stated below: There is the opportunity to apply fixed dental prosthesis with a single surgery to patients without teeth. As no advanced surgery like sinus elevation or addition of bones are applied, operation is much easier. Period of dental implant surgery is much shorter. As number of dental implants used are less and no additional surgical process is required, its cost is lower than classic dental implant treatment. It provides an aesthetic appearance and smiling line that is planned individually for people. It is much easier to clean and take care of them when compared with fixed dental prosthesis on classic dental implants. It is suitable for patients who can not use mobile dental prosthesis and who have nausea reflex. Its design is different from full dental prosthesis. As it does not cover the patient’s palate, it is much easier to get used to it and to use them. As number of required treatment sessions is low, it is appropriate for patients residing abroad.",
      "To Whom Can All On Four Implant Technique Be Applied?": "All On Four treatment can be applied to all patients without teeth (not having any teeth) who don’t have any systematic disease that could create an obstacle for dental implant surgery and who have sufficient bone mass.",
      "What Are the Stages of All On Four Treatment?": "First of all, a detailed clinic and radiological examination should be done to patients for whom All On Four treatment is planned. By making measurements through computerized tomography (CT), a suitable plan is made for the patient. All On Four procedure is composed of two parts as surgery and dental prosthesis process. After 4 pieces of dental implants are applied to the patient on the first day of treatment, temporary dental prosthesis is fixed on dental implants on the same day. 3 months later permanent teeth prosthesis is applied to the patient.",
      "Will I Have Any Pain After All On Four Process?": "Just like the case after each dental implant operation, a certain amount of pain and swelling can occur after operation. But these complaints can be easily controlled by taking the medicines recommended by your doctor.",
      "I Am Very Afraid of Surgery": "All On Four process is a procedure that can be easily applied under local anesthesia. But it can be realized with sedation or under general anesthesia for patients with anxiety and high level of fear.",
      "How Will I Get My Nutrition After All On Four Process?": "After the process, you can immediately use the temporary dental prosthesis being fixed on dental implants. But during the 3-month period when dental implants integrate with the bone, you should get a diet that is recommended by your doctor. With your permanent prosthesis that will be applied after the process of 3 months is completed, you can get your nutrition as you wish.",
      "Is All On Four Process a Successful Procedure?": "The studies conducted show that All On Four process is a treatment method yielding high success ratio in long-term follow-ups."

    "All On Six Implants": {
      "What is All On Six Implant Technique?": "The All-On-Six dental implant procedure is a technique used to restore the entire upper or lower arch of teeth using six dental implants. It is called 'All-On-Six' because it typically involves the placement of six dental implants to support a full arch prosthesis.",
      "What Are The Advantages of All On Six Implant Technique?": "Some advantages of the All-On-Six implant technique include: 1. Provides a stable and secure foundation for a full set of teeth. 2. Helps prevent further bone loss in the jaw. 3. Offers a permanent solution for missing teeth. 4. Improves chewing and speech function. 5. Enhances overall facial appearance and smile.",
      "To Whom Can All On Six Implant Technique Be Applied?": "The All-On-Six implant technique can be applied to individuals who are missing all or most of their teeth in one arch (either upper or lower) and have enough bone density to support the implants. It is also suitable for patients who are looking for a more permanent and stable alternative to traditional dentures.",
      "What Are the Stages of All On Six Treatment?": "The stages of All-On-Six treatment typically include: 1. Consultation and treatment planning: A comprehensive examination and imaging studies are done to determine the best treatment approach. 2. Implant placement: Six dental implants are surgically placed into the jawbone. 3. Healing period: A period of several months is allowed for the implants to integrate with the bone (osseointegration). 4. Prosthesis fabrication: Once the implants have healed, a custom-made full arch prosthesis is attached to the implants.",
      "Will I Have Any Pain After All On Six Process?": "Pain after the All-On-Six procedure is usually mild and can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication. Your dentist or oral surgeon will provide you with specific instructions for pain management.",
      "I Am Very Afraid of Surgery": "If you are very afraid of surgery, your dentist or oral surgeon may offer sedation options to help you relax during the procedure. It's important to discuss your fears and concerns with your dental care team.",
      "How Will I Get My Nutrition After All On Six Process?": "After the All-On-Six process, you will be able to eat a normal diet. However, it may be recommended to start with softer foods and gradually progress to a regular diet as you adjust to your new teeth.",
      "Is All On Six Process a Successful Procedure?": "The success rate of the All-On-Six implant procedure is very high, with studies showing success rates of over 95% in the long term. However, individual results may vary, and it's important to follow your dentist's instructions for care and maintenance of your dental implants."

    "Bad Breath": {
      "What is Bad Breath?": "Halitosis (bad breath) is the bad odor in the breath that comes out from mouth or nose which disturbs both the person and the people around. Bad breath has a negative impact on interpersonal relations and it causes problems like social pressure, psychological stress, and lack of self-confidence to occur for the person. Even social and individual isolation can be seen due to problems relating to bad breath (Halitosis).",
      "Is Bad Breath Seen In Everyone?": "Bad breath can be frequently seen in people of all ages in the community. In at least 50% of adults, at some time in their lives and especially after waking up, a bad breath which cannot be socially accepted is observed. Researches show that in men bad breath is observed 3 times more than in women. Furthermore, in individuals above the age of 20, it is observed 3 times more than in youngsters.",
      "Does Bad Breath Increase with Age?": "In individuals from the middle age group, especially during morning times, a heavy bad breath is observed. In people with advanced ages, mouth odor is seen more due to the prosthesis used, loss of fluidity of saliva, and systematic diseases.",
      "What Are the Reasons for Bad Breath?": "Reasons for bad breath could be pathological or physiological and in some cases, both of them could be seen together. 80-90% of pathological halitosis arises as relating to the mouth and 10-20% of it arises due to reasons not relating to the mouth.",
      "From Where Does This Odor Come As My Oral and Dental Health Is Fine?": "The easiest way to discriminate those with mouth origin and those originating from areas other than mouth is to compare mouth and nose odors because when reasons arising from areas other than mouth are considered for halitosis, the first organ coming to one's mind is nose. Respiration from the nose should be the preferred respiration type. Respiration from the mouth, which has an important place in the etiology of halitosis, happens as a result of nose stuffiness."

    "Bone Grafts": {
      "What Is Chin Bone Powder (Bone Graft)?": "Bone grafts that are named as bone powder are obtained in different ways. Grafts which are produced as human origined, animal origined or as synthetically, are produced either as powder or blocks.",
      "In What Cases Are Chin Bone Powders Used?": "Bone grafts are used in cases when there are insufficient bones in the region where dental implants will be made, in cases where implants are made in the same session when teeth are extracted, in operations where sinus basis is elevated before implant or during teeth extraction when chronic infection takes place and bone loss can take place. The cells it contains and by means of substances required for bone formation and growth, it helps for fast recovery and for improvement of bone mass."
    },
    "Bone Cyst": {
      "What Is a Jaw Cyst Removal Surgery?": "Odontogenic (dental) cysts can form anywhere in the mouth. The patient notices the cyst after it causes pain or swelling or the cyst may grow without being noticed. Although treatment methods depend on the location and size of the cyst, they should be removed by oral and dental surgeons.",
      "What Kind of Problems Do Jaw Cysts cause? What Happens If It is Not Removed?": "Odontogenic cysts are generally benign and slow-growing, however, if not intervened on time, they can grow very large in size and damage anatomical spaces such as the sinus, nasal cavity, and nerves, or show signs of malignancy (may transform into malignant tumors).",
      "How Is Jaw Cyst Removal Surgery Performed? Can It Be Operated Under Anesthesia?": "Root canal treatment is applied to teeth that are affected by the cyst. The gums around the cyst are anesthetized with anesthetic gels. Afterwards, they are anesthetized again using digital anesthesia painlessly. A small incision is made from the area of the gum where it is easiest to reach the cyst, and cyst is removed with minimum bone loss. After the cyst is removed, the incision is closed up and the remaining bone is left to heal. The removed piece should be examined in the pathology laboratory. The cysts that are too large need to be removed under general anesthesia. During the examination, your doctor will decide how to proceed.",
      "Is the Removal of Jaw Cysts Painful?": "Cyst removal operation is not different from procedures such as tooth extraction and implant. It is done painlessly under an effective and sufficient amount of anesthesia. Afterward, just as in other surgical procedures, antibiotics, you should use pain medication, and antiseptic mouthwashes recommended by your doctor. With frequent check-ups, you will experience an easy recovery process."
    },
    "Bleeding Gums": {
      "What is Gum Bleeding and Why Does it Occur?": "Gum bleeding refers to the leakage of blood elements outside of the vessels due to the disruption of the structure of the vessels that nourish the gum tissue, which develops due to the presence of attachments such as plaque and calculus on the tooth surface associated with gum disease. In other words, bleeding gums are the initial sign of inflammatory gum disease. This bleeding can occur in response to stimuli (touching, brushing, etc.) or spontaneously. In addition to this, factors such as vigorous brushing, protruding or poorly done fillings, cavities, and ill-fitting prostheses can also cause bleeding. Pregnancy, menstruation, menopause, blood disorders, diabetes, deficiencies in vitamins C and K, genetic predisposition, and the use of blood thinning medications can also manifest as gum bleeding.",
      "How is Gum Bleeding Treated?": "Gum bleeding is treated by diagnosing the causative factor and implementing appropriate measures. This includes scaling and root planing if necessary, along with plaque removal. Proper patient care is crucial during the healing process. Therefore, proper brushing and the use of dental floss or interdental brushes should be included as necessary. If there are cavities present, they should be treated, and ill-fitting fillings or prostheses should be corrected or replaced. Any systemic problems that may cause bleeding should be identified and discussed with the patient's physician."
    },
    "Toothache": {
      "What Is Toothache?": "Toothache can originate from the tooth itself or the surrounding tissues. While some of these pains may result from simple food impaction or irritation from hot beverages and may not require treatment, generally, the underlying cause of the pain indicates a more significant issue that requires treatment by a dentist. The severity of toothache varies greatly depending on the type, size of the causative factor, and individual pain threshold. While a simple gum recession may only cause discomfort when consuming cold items, a tooth root infection can be discomforting enough to disturb sleep at night. Assessing the seriousness of the condition based solely on the intensity of the pain is not a reliable method. Sometimes, significant bone loss in the jaw may not cause any discomfort to the patient, while a minor loss in a filling can significantly reduce quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly consult your dentist if you notice any abnormalities in your teeth, and even if you have no complaints, do not skip routine check-ups every six months.",
      "Causes of Toothache": "Cavities, wear and tear, sudden abscesses, tooth fractures or cracks due to accidents, infections in the gums, infections in the jawbones, new teeth emerging in children, old fillings/crowns that have become loose, some impacted teeth and wisdom teeth. These are sources of pain that require treatment by a dentist. Paying attention to these pains signaling a problem and seeking treatment is of great importance, as untreated dental infections can pose life-threatening risks.",
      "Treatment for Toothache": "To treat toothache, it is necessary to first identify the source of the pain. This is determined through an oral examination, X-rays, intraoral photographs, and patient history. The treatment can vary significantly depending on the situation. Sometimes, only a sensitivity-reducing toothpaste is needed, while other times, filling, crowning, root canal treatment, gum treatment, or tooth extraction may be necessary. The key is that the earlier the problem is diagnosed, the smaller the treatment required.",
      "Should I Take Antibiotics When My Tooth Hurts?": "Antibiotics are specialized drugs developed to combat harmful bacteria in the body. However, the content and dosage of antibiotics vary depending on the type of bacteria, the patient's age, weight, allergies, and other conditions. Additionally, while antibiotics kill harmful bacteria, they can also harm beneficial flora in our bodies. Due to these risks, their over-the-counter sale is prohibited in our country. To prevent unnecessary antibiotic use, do not take antibiotics without consulting your doctor."
    },
    "Dental Implants": {
      "What are Dental Implants?": "A dental implant is a titanium screw system to which a prosthesis is placed in cases of a missing tooth. Dental implants placed in the jawbone serve as a substitute for the tooth root. In cases of a single missing tooth, it is possible to replace the missing tooth without touching the adjacent healthy teeth, and thanks to dental implants, it is possible to use fixed prostheses instead of removable prostheses in cases of multiple missing teeth. In cases of total edentulism, thanks to implants, it is possible to fixate removable prostheses, which are difficult to use especially in the lower jaw, and tend to frequently come out of the mouth.",
      "What Does the Dental Implant Treatment Process Involve?": "Placing of prostheses in dental implant treatment takes longer compared to conventional treatments because it takes around 2.5 to 4 months for the titanium structure to integrate with the bone, and, if any additional operations are done on the jawbone or sinus lifting procedure is carried out, this process can extend up to 6 months. However, the results are very satisfactory and longer-lasting.",
      "What are the Advantages of Dental Implant?": "The existing prostheses of patients, especially those who have been edentate for many years, lose compatibility over time due to the constant change in the bones and begin to move and cause scars. As implant-supported prostheses are placed on a fixed foundation, it cannot move or be removed from the mouth. It can be applied to people who do not want removable prosthesis or whose bone has lost its retention.",
      "Is Dental Implant Surgery Difficult?": "The operation, which is conducted under local anesthesia by anesthetizing only the area where the implant will be placed, is painless. Treatment process is quite comfortable if prescribed medicine is taken before the operation, antiseptic mouthwash is used after, and oral care is done properly.",
      "Will My Face Swell Too Much After the Dental Implant Operation? Will I Feel a Lot of Pain?": "Slight swelling and color changes on cheeks are expected, however, edema would swiftly decrease if cold compress is applied within the first 24 hours after the operation. Intense pain is not observed. The painkillers recommended by the dentist are sufficient to easily relieve the pain that may develop within the first day.",
      "What Does the Dental Implant Process Include? How Long Does It Take To Be Completed?": "The retention of the implants to the bone takes an average of 3 months for the implants in the upper jaw and 2 months for the implants in the lower jaw, and afterward, porcelain veneers are applied to them. The retention process may be as long as 6 months if any additional operations have been made due to thin or insufficiently leveled bones.",
      "Is Dental Implant Without Sutures Possible?": "It is possible in cases where only one tooth is pulled out and an implant is placed without cutting the gum in its empty socket.",
      "Is There Any Possibility of Harm by Dental Implants? Sometimes the Body Rejects Implants. Is It True?": "Dental implants are made of titanium. Titanium, which is extremely biocompatible with the body, is a precious nontoxic metal that does not pose a risk of triggering allergic reactions.",
      "Is Dental Implant Right Choice for Me?": "Its application to patients who have systemic diseases that cannot be kept under control, as well as those who recently received radiotherapy and chemotherapy is unfavorable. However, as long as the disease is under control, implants can be applied to everyone. If the number of bone is insufficient in the examination, implants can be placed after a bone substructure is created with additional procedures.",
      "I am a Smoker. Can I Get Dental Implants?": "It has been proven by many studies that smoking prevents the retention of the implant with the bone. The risk of the implant falling off is 2 to 3 times higher than normal for smokers.",
      "Are Dental Implants Durable?": "The lifespan of dental implants is as long as natural teeth. They can be used for a very long time as long as standard oral care is done properly.",
      "I Do Not Want to Wait for 2 to 3 Months. Can I Use My Dentures with Dental Implants?": "Yes. With the help of the mini dental implant technology, the removable dentures can be compatibly used with implants after the operation."

    "Impacted Teeth": {
      "What are Impacted Teeth?": "The teeth that have not erupted when they should have and remained under gum or bone are called impacted teeth.",
      "Which Teeth Can Be Impacted?": "Wisdom teeth, canines, and premolars can be impacted. When it is determined that they cannot be brought to their places orthodontically (using braces), they should be removed by jaw surgeons.",
      "When and How Should Impacted Teeth Be Extracted?": "Wisdom teeth are located at the very back of the mouth. Since they are located at a point that is difficult to reach and see, brushing and caring for them can be more difficult compared to the other teeth. Due to insufficient brushing, wisdom teeth easily decay, causing pain and bad breath. In some cases, wisdom teeth cannot erupt because of the lack of space in the jaws. They can remain fully impacted (not seen in the mouth, stay under both the gum and jawbone), or they can become a part of the oral environment by remaining semi-impacted under the gum. In this case, they cause the consumed foods to get stuck and accumulate in the area where they erupt, and thus causing infection. This situation, which causes swelling and redness in the gums around the wisdom teeth, severe pain spreading to the neck and ear, swelling of the lymph gland, and feeling pain while opening the mouth and swallowing, is called pericoronitis. Fully impacted wisdom teeth, on the other hand, can push the teeth in front of them and create crowdedness (crookedness) in the teeth. In addition, they can cause the decay of the neighboring tooth by pressuring it. Impacted wisdom teeth that have not been noticed for many years can cause serious problems by contributing to the formation of cysts that reach large sizes within the jaw. Even if they do not cause any problems, wisdom teeth may need to be extracted for orthodontic treatment in order to align other teeth properly. For such reasons, wisdom teeth need to be extracted under local anesthesia.",
      "How Should Oral Care and Diet Be After the Impacted Tooth Operation?": "Spitting, tooth brushing, vigorous mouth rinsing, using straws, and mouthwash should be avoided on the first day after the extraction. Warm, non-granular, and soft foods should be consumed on the first two days after the operation. After each food consumption and tooth brushing, antiseptic mouthwashes recommended by the doctor should be used. Painkillers and, if recommended by the dentist, antibiotics should be used regularly. You should not smoke for the first 48 hours after the operation as it will disrupt the healing process.",
      "Will There Be a Lot Of Pain After Impacted Tooth Extraction?": "After a fast and efficient surgery, there is not much pain, and the pain can be easily controlled with mild painkillers.",
      "Will My Face Swell a Lot After The Impacted Tooth Extraction?": "Edema in the cheek depends on the condition of the tooth and varies from person to person. In order to prevent swelling, a cold compress (ice compress) should be applied to the cheek area in the first 24 hours after the operation. Slight swelling is normal and is part of the healing process."
